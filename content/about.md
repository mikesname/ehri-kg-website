{{< intro >}}
The [European Holocaust Research Infrastructure (EHRI)](https://www.ehri-project.eu) is an international 
infrastructure securing Holocaust research, commemoration and education on a trans-national level. 

EHRI-KG is a project funded by the [OSCARS project](https://oscars-project.eu) which seeks to convert the EHRI's Portal data into a Knowledge Graph in order to promote data interoperability in the field.

## Scientific objectives
The project aims to address the following overarching objectives:
* Align EHRI Portal data with the recently-released Records in Contexts Conceptual Model (RiC-CM) 1.0.2
* Formalise ontology extensions
* Expand the scope of the KG
* Develop the technical architecture for ensuring timely updates to the Knowledge Graph
* Record linkage

## Project structure
In order to reach those objectives the project is divided in these work packages:
  * WP1: Management and dissemination
  * WP2: Ontological development & alignment
  * WP3: Hosting and data ingest infrastructure
  * WP4: Linking EHRI entities to other KGs
