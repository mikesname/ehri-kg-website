The European Holocaust Research Infrastructure (EHRI) aims to enhance access to information about Holocaust-related 
historical sources and promote transnational scholarship. Through the EHRI Portal it makes available over 370,000 
archival descriptions, from 2,000 institutions worldwide.

**EHRI-KG** is an [OSCARS-funded](https://oscars-project.eu) project to develop a comprehensive **_Linked Open Data_** (LOD) Knowledge Graph (KG) to complement 
the EHRI Portal, further advancing data accessibility and aligning with the evolving semantic web and LOD standards.
